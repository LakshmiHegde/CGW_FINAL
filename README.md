# Crowdsourced Gifting Website

## Problem statement: 
People buy gifts from e-commerce Websites or Local Shops. 
Problems with E-commerce gift items are :- 
a) one can not trust the authenticity of products. 
b) It takes more time to deliver items (2-7 days)
Problems with Local shops are :- 
a) one can not find good gift shops in his/her nearby area, as these shops are not visited frequently by people.
b) Sending a Delicate gift or sweets to far away friends through normal delivery options is risky and time consuming.
Due to these problems, people end up giving less precious and generic gifts to their loved-ones in a hurry-burry.

## Solution :- 
Online Crowdsource shopping platform for personalized gifting of  FLOWERS, SWEETS, TOYS, GIFTS, GREETING CARDS etc.. Our website acts as the connecting bridge between customers and partner Gift Shops.

## Crowdsource concept :- 
One can order gifts to their own home from local shops that are in their area or send gifts to their loved ones directly to their location from gift shops that are located in the recipient's area. Thus delivery happens within 3-4 hours.

## There are three main roles: 
### 1. Customer 
Users can locate Gift Shops which are nearby to their location or to their loved ones location. 
They can home deliver Gift items to themselves or directly to their loved ones.

### 2. Partner Shopkeepers
